# üèÜ UEFA Champions League Group Stage Draw Simulator üèÜ

Welcome to the UEFA Champions League Group Stage Draw Simulator, where code meets football magic! ‚öΩ

## What Is This?

Ever wondered how the UEFA Champions League groups are drawn? Look no further! This Python code simulates the thrilling process where teams are sorted, shuffled, and assigned to groups, all while respecting UEFA's complex rules. It's like playing Cupid for football teams, only without the arrows.

## How to Run

1. Install Python on your computer if you haven't already. (Hint: Python is like the universal language for programmers, just like football is the universal language for fans!)

2. Clone this repository and open it in your favourite code editor. If you don't have a favourite code editor yet, don't worry; you'll find one as you dive deeper into coding, just like you discovered your love for football.

3. Run the code and watch the magic unfold. You'll see teams jumping in and out of pots like they're auditioning for a magic show.

## What's Inside

- Team Data: We've got a list of teams with names, leagues, and coefficients. It's like a "Who's Who" of the football world.

- Pot Seeding: We sort teams into pots like sorting socks after doing laundry. The best go in Pot 1, the next best in Pot 2, and so on.

- Group Drawing: We distribute teams into groups, but it's not just any distribution; it's a dance of algorithms, ensuring fairness and following UEFA rules. Teams from the same country or league don't get too cozy in the same group.

- Output: You get to see the result, like opening a box of chocolates to find out what's inside each group. üç´
